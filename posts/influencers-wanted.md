This last week, we signed a contract with a marketing firm for full service influencer marketing.

We were really not having any luck with Google or Facebook ads and I believe this is heavily connected to a lack of social proof. Our handful of reviews from friends and family just isn't enough.

So, to influencer marketing we turned.

# One Problem
We don't really do social media. Even our personal accounts are rather ill-attended to, and the whole idea of influencers doesn't really strike us as a meaningful thing, despite the proven effectiveness.

Additionally, after watching the Social Dilemma, we had deleted all our social media apps.

Clearly, we were not the ones to take this over ourselves.

## Enter the Agency
My brother works for Grin, a company that produces an influencer marketing platform and management system. I approached them to see if their product would be right for us, however, it is really for much larger companies, and they referred me to Mutesix, as a full service influencer marketing agency.

While the fee was much steeper than we were hoping for, we decided to go along with it. At the cost they are asking, our runway is rather short to get some meaningful results, but if it is looking good, we won't have much issue injecting some additional capital to get Teapaz moving towards profitability. We're still young and make good enough money independently that we can support Teapaz if it is showing promise.

So that's where we are today. We are filling out documentation for the Agency to understand our brand, product, hopes, and dreams, from a nice cafe in the Changi Jewel, while sipping on Matcha Lattes (we are nothing if not consistent).

Our first campaign with them should be starting around 2 weeks from now, scheduling pending.

Hopefully this goes well.

In the meantime, I have a lot of work to put into our business backend to get our email campaigns set up to help push our new customers towards being true fans!
