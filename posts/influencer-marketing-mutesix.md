As of October 28th (One week ago as of this writing), MuteSix has officially started work on managing our Influencer Marketing Program.

The process has been pretty pain-free, aside from the big burning hole in the TEAPAZ wallet. Their service doesn't come cheap, at least to a small struggling business. It's $4000 a month to get 20 influencers to do 1 feed post and 3-5 stories each.

When I was looking at maybe doing this ourselves, the prices were not necessarily much cheaper, and we would probably waste quite a bit from being unsure of even how to handle this kind of thing.

## The Process Thus Far
We had a meeting last Friday as our first official meeting on contract. We had had 2 meetings prior to get connected and discuss the plans before official work began.

Most importantly, we also received an initial list of potential Influencers as well as the template for the email communication to the influencers.

It was especially interesting to see how they adapted the things we discussed in the meetings as well as our on-store copy into these email templates. It is a simple process, but it is one I would not have even known where to begin with.

It's similar to doing product messaging based on voice of customer research in my RO work. The process is pretty simple, and sometimes the output almost looks out right basic, but it is difficult to get there without the proper process.

## My View on Weekly Meetings
Right now, MuteSix is planning on having weekly meetings to communicate anything important. I'm mostly against this, but I know this may be useful at least for these first few weeks. I'm hiring them because I don't know how to do this, and a simple weekly document mentioning any happenings is enough.

I don't see myself as paying them for meetings. I'm paying them to manage influencers. I trust them, and I don't know what I'm doing. What good input would I have?

If in 2 weeks the meetings still seem unnecessary, I'll just tell my account manager to stop with the meetings.

## Next Steps
They have just started outreach to the various influencers, so hopefully we'll start to see them respond and give us their details for their free product soon. We have quite a few things we need to finish up on the store in the meantime.

- **Email Capture Modal** - We need to ensure that the visitors we get have multiple opportunities for conversion. If we can get their email and the permission to market to them, then we can capture their sales later on. We decided to go with a Free Product Giveaway, so that the discount codes we are giving to the influencers does not compete with the email capture.
- **Subscription Setup** - Matcha is a consumable, so it's ideal to have a subscription model. This can also ensure that we maintain a high Lifetime Value, making the cost of the marketing actions minimal by comparison.
- **Email Flows Set Up** - We basically don't have any of our email flows set up properly. So we need to get a bunch of the basic flows implemented in a minor way so that we can capitalize on the traffic we do get in the best way possible!

Those are the main tasks we need to get through quickly. I hope we can get some of this done this weekend.

I'll be back in a week or two with an update on our influencer issue!
