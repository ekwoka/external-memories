As part of my foray into personal improvement, I started following [CGP Grey's suggestion regarding having personal themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE). I've done this throughout the last year to...varying degrees of success.

However, this time I'm putting a lot more effort into it.

So, for this Fall of 2020, my theme is 

## Organization
This covers multiple things, from the organization of my information, my knowledge, and my physical space. The last bit may be a bit harder, as entropy will decay my efforts, meanwhile the organization of knowledge will not decay. It may, however, require some gardening. 

### On Organizing Thoughts
This blog itself plays a role in enabling me to organize my mind. Journaling is generally recognized as being a helpful habit, and I feel that putting it public will encourage me to more fully flesh out thoughts and ideas than if these were 100 percent personal notes.

### On Organizing Information
This sites wiki articles will be about organizing my knowledge, so that I don't need to rely on my mind so much to remember the relationships between information, or the sources of information I saw in the past. Instead I can have these articles written in my own words about the aspects of the topics I found most interesting or relevant.

## The How
To aid in all of this, of course, is [Obsidian](/wiki/obsidian/), my note-taking app of choice. It integrates well with Onedrive so I can access and edit my notes on my Surface, Macbook, and my s10lite. This, hopefully, will enable me to more easily document thoughts, both to preserve the useful ones for later, as well as to offload the mental resources for those that may be irrelevant now.

[Obsidian](https://Obsidian.md) uses a very freeform method for notetaking. The app itself can work with many different kinds of note-taking systems, but it is designed specifically with [Zettelkasten](/wiki/zettelkasten/) in mind. So notes are designed to be interconnected and somewhat atomic.

I don't yet fully understand the atomic notes aspect. I still prefer having notes that are many paragraphs long and a bit more comprehensive, but with time, as my notes grow, I hope I'll get a better grasp of how I can make these notes more atomic than they are currently (some notes right now are over 2000 words long, and I think most should probably be more like 100 or less)

### Daily Journaling
Alongside these more general systems of information management, I am also doing daily journaling in Obsidian. This includes a short check list of to-dos, a short journaling, a gratitude section, and then a catalog of things that were not completed, mainly of the things from the to-do list.

The gratitude post, I've decided to split into 2 sections. The first being general about anything in the world, from internet being pretty cool, to my company providing me a sweet new macbook.

The second is specifically about gratitude towards my girlfriend, to help me regularly refocus on all the things I love about her. We're likely to only remember 20% of our lives (80% of our memories are of 20% of our life), and I want it to be the grand moments, and not the minor disruptions.

## The Goals
Strict goals aren't fully in keeping with the idea of personal themes, as goals can be failed, and resolutions delayed, while a good [Theme System](/wiki/theme-system/) works by encouraging a trend of growth in the desired direction, as life is a journey, and the trend-line is what matters.

That being said, I hope to have 15 blog posts by the start of winter, and 20 wiki articles up as well.

On the smaller scope, of course, I hope to maintain my daily journaling and gratitude posts. While sometimes they are wildly inconvenient when I just want to sleep or do something else, they build a strong habit of looking over the day and thinking of how my day went, where I failed, where I triumphed, and how I felt through it all.

Whatever, that's the end of this post. I don't know how to sign off a blog post yet.

Toodles.
