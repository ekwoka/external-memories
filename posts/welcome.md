# Welcome to My External Memories
Something I've generally been struggling with for most of my life, but even more so recently with the massive increases in complexity my life has undergone in terms of work and life-long learning, is how to properly manage my information.

I've almost always relied almost entirely on my brain to organize and recall information or, at a minimum, where to find that information again. I've never been one for taking any serious notes. Even in the points in life where I tried to do notes, I would take notes, but never have a meaningful reason to refer to them.

However, in my work as a Revenue Optimization Expert and Build Grow Scale, I'm beginning to do a lot more deep learning on the subjects of User Experience Design, Design Research, Copywriting, and even Web Development.

These are topics that, when applied, are intricately woven and deeply nuanced. In that regard it becomes easy for me to be wrapped up in a rabbit hole of learning new things, and digging through old things in my head. When this happens my brain can often get spun up to a degree that actually makes completing real work difficult. The thought processes themselves become distracting from their own goals.

In addition to that, I've taken on roles as an educator of sorts, writing and instructing for video courses on these subjects that tantalize me so, as well as writing blog posts or discussing in podcasts.

## This is where note-taking comes in
If a significant part of the end result of my learning and research is to be able to compile and produce unique content, I'm best served by actually documenting ideas and concepts as I'm experiencing them and learning them, so that the structure of new content can become clear simply from reviewing my existing knowledge that has already been scribbled and structured in my own words.

For this, I've begun using Obsidian as a note-taking app through the process knwon as Zettelkasten. Zettelkasten itself is an extremely deep topic, not meant for this post, but suffice it to say that Zettelkasten is essentially like creating a wide array of deeply specific notes that are relationally connected.

It's like a wiki site where every article is trying to be as small as possible and link to ass many other things as possible.

## Then What is External Memories?
This site will be a combination blog and wiki with the main topic being my own journey through digital marketing as well as documentation that others may be able to find value from. Basically, I'm trying to offload all of the knowledge I've collected and will collect to this site, in the hopes that I can reduce my internal dialogue and better structure my ideas in a manner that a non-crazy person can understand.

In time this site may grow, or I may give up on it and instead focus on this note-taking process as a purely private endeavor. However, I like the idea of working with the garage door open, where others could see and benefit from this journey. Not that I have much expectation that anyone would ever find this site.

Well, that's the start. Expect another post in 6 months apologizing for not keeping this updated.
