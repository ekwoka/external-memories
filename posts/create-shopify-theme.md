At this time of writing, my Spring of Creation is just beginning, and one of the creations I want to pursue for the next 93 days is making my own Shopify Theme.

## Why Shopify?
In my day job I work as an Ecommerce UX consultant, working with clients to research, test, and implement changes to their UI, in the efforts of improving revenue.

This is mostly working with Shopify, and the firm I work for, [Build Grow Scale](https://buildgrowscale.com), has a custom Shopify Theme that we provide to clients of various levels.

However, I find this theme clunky, and difficult to maintain. It's primarily spaghetti code, and I'm not a fan.

It works really well for many of your clients and they love it, but I think we can do much better.

## Why AlpineJS and TailwindCSS?
There are loads of different tools and frameworks out there for getting websites made. Generally speaking, anything that's good enough is good enough, right?

So it doesn't matter all that much, but these interested me for being very lightweight.

Naturally, in an ecommerce setting, speed is exceptionally important. Beyond a baseline 3s loading time, every second can be costing a store between 4% and 7% conversions. For how simple the interactions are on an online store, we shouldn't be taking that long to serve up content!

So of course, we need a lightweight framework, as we don't need the capabilities of a powerful, app, just some small optimizations.

AlpineJS allows us to lightly improve our markup with some extra power, and Tailwind CSS keeps our CSS light and maintainable.

## The Process
Over the course of this Spring of Creation, I'll be documenting my process along with the hurdles and accomplishments along the way.

Hopefully this ends up being helpful to someone, or even just helpful to myself, as a demonstration of what it's like to work with AllineJS and TailwindCSS.
