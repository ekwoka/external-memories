So, at the beginning of August we were able to finally soft launch our Matcha brand [Teapaz](https://teapaz.com) and after a few weeks waiting for product photography, we started running proper ads last week.

The problem right now is that we are getting quite a few visitors but no sales. They are mostly from users searching for "Matcha" and related keywords on Google, as Facebook ads need more data to get spooled up and running properly.

Anyway, in the past few days we've driven nearly 200 customers, but no bites. We can make a hundred guesses at the potential hangups, but we just don't really have the kind of data necessary to know any way for sure.

## But aren't you an expert?
This is where I feel like I'm having the most problems. My skill set that I've mostly trained has been in refining working UX and messaging to get more sales, but on the basis of analyzing user data.

So, while I can go through and identy dozens, if not hundreds, of potential pain points users could be getting stopped by, I have no data to know which of those, if any will have a meaningful impact and move the needle.

I'd suspect the biggest issue is that we have so few reviews, only 5, from friends and family. That isn't something we can just fix like so many other things.

I suspect, then, that changes to the messaging that would help handle purchase anxiety will be the best candidates for getting results.

## Addressing Anxiety
One thing I know could be holding users back, is that they may not be sure that $30 matcha is actually worth it. Much cheaper matcha exists, and some of it can be enjoyable enough. Until I really tried more expensive Matcha, I didn't realize that it could be so much better.

With getting more reviews not entirely up to my own abilities, I think creating and promoting a satisfaction guarantee could be the decent way to address this. Of course, they can still not trust that we really mean what we say, but we can't do much about that.

So, as we develop our Unique Value Proposition icons to put below the ATC, I think we will add one for a money back guarantee.

Like so:

Hopefully this will get some matcha moving.
