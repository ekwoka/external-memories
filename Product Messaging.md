#### Summary
This course covers the process of developing some focused [[Voice of Customer]] research into very powerful [[Copywriting|conversion copy]]. This course covers the overall concepts involved in addressing user concerns with copy, but what really makes it shine is the specific process it prevents for handling this research and producing final copy.

A lot of [[Copywriting]] courses and materials paint it as a very creative process, and provide strategies for weaving in [[Cognitive Bias]] and emotional appeals. This course presents an opposing option. Highly data-driven copy decisions. How to identify and mine good copy written by customers and piece that together into powerful copy, with little need for creative skills.

#### Case Study
I'm working with Rosemary right now on a project to [[All33 Copy Revamp|revamp the copy on All33]] using this strategy. In time the results will be moved here.

#### Step 0
Step Zero wasn't directly included in the process, but I feel it's important. Step Zero is the use of [[User Research]] to identify the fact that there is a problem that should be addressed. Jumping straight into Step One may not always be needed, considering that there might not actually be a serious problem.

In the most practical case, the [[User Research]] will often be a [[Post-purchase Survey]] as this is the cheapest and easiest way to identify user concerns. Once this is completed, you should understand the concerns your users have regarding the product. If these concerns seem strong, and follow up suggests that these are truly not being addressed, then Step 1 can begin. If the concerns seem strong, but are being addressed, but possibly missed or misunderstood, then this whole process doesn't need to happen, and iterative improvements can just be made to the current copy.
