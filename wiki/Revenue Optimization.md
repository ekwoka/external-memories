Revenue Optimization (RO) is the continual process of analyzing, diagnosing, and improving [[User Experience]] systems. In this specific context, we are referring to [[ecommerce]] systems. This is a facet of [[Digital Marketing]] that focuses on the store website itself, and less on outward maketing efforts.

## The Important of RO

## CRO vs RO
The preferred term at [[Build Grow Scale]] is RO, for Revenue Optimization. But others in the industry often refer to this process as CRO for [[Conversion Rate]] Optimization.

The issue with CRO is that it gives undue focus to [[Conversion Rate]], the percentage of visitors that buy. This ignores the impact that [[Average Order Value]] and [[Revenue per User]] have on the end goal of the company: making a profit.

Meanwhile RO places the emphasis on the [[Revenue]].

I'm personally partial to CRO as Continuous Revenue Optimization (a variation I learned from [[Kill Your Conversion Killers]], as it gives more attention to the fact that this is a continuous process, and not simply a singular task or set of tasks.

## Necessary RO Skills
Being an RO is not actually all that complicated, and doesn't require any classical education. In fact, like most [[Digital Marketing]] fields, classical education doesn't really offer much in this area. You just can't learn this at a traditional institution.

That being said, there are modern digital institutes that specialize in this kind of training like [[Ecommerce Academy|Build Grow Scale Ecommerce Academy]], [[CXL Institute|Conversion XL Institute]], and [[Baymard|Baymard Institute]] that have specialized courses and certifications for store owners and digital marketers alike.

There are some skills that are necessary to be successful in this field.

- Ability to learn fast
- Procedural mindset
- Willingness to be wrong

All other skills are pretty easily transferable but these are much harder.
