## Design
This leather laptop bag is over-engineered with no breakable parts like magnets, zippers, snaps, buttons, etc. Just a few pieces of strong leather put together in a good looking way. And is reinforced at all stress points with rivets and hidden polyester strapping. Leather that is pulled on, stretches, but these straps don't. The leather briefcase is built with the largest pieces of leather possible so there are fewer seams, and we sew at only 5 stitches per inch so there's more leather between the needle holes and fewer holes to start a tear. The closure is a classic Gladstone bag closure which does not require a zipper. Zippers break. Our lining that backs up the leather is tougher than the leather which is better than some pretty shiny lightweight nylon fabric with an old world map on it to make you feel adventurous.  

- No breakable parts (margnets, zippers, snaps)
- Reinforced with Rivets and Higgen Polyester Strapping
- Gladstone Bag Closure
- Fewer Seams, Fewer Holes

## Materials
### Leather
Our leather is the strongest we can find (full-grain boot leather, but thicker). It's important to understand this. The top layer of a leather hide has all of the grain in it. The grain is the toughest, most protective and longest lasting part of the hide. The grain is like the shingles on a roof. The best part. Most companies shave off the top layer (grain) of the hide to get rid of scars so they can use almost every inch of the hide in production and therefore save money. But in doing so, it's like they're shaving the shingles off of your roof. There ought to be a law.

- Full-grain boot leather, but thicker
- Strongest Leather we can find

### Lining
We use pigskin lining, which is stronger than the cow leather, instead of some pretty shiny fabric with a world map on it. 

- Pigskin Lining

### Thread
The thread is unbelievably strong industrial marine grade UV resistant polyester thread. It's what they use when people could die if the thread fails. Like on sails and parachutes. We use it to hold together leather briefcases. This thread is much more expensive than the common nylon "snowflake" thread that falls apart with sunshine or heat or if you just look at it crooked.

- Industrial Marine Grade Polyester Thread
- UV resistant
- Same as used on Sails and Parachutes

### Hardware
Our custom hardware is the amazing 316 Stainless Steel (please please google it). It's the metal of choice when your life depends on it. A metallergist told me that is was way overkill and that I really didn't need it to be so strong. I guess it's like killing a fly with a shotgun for a leather briefcase, but we NEVER have problems with our hardware.

## Functionality
This mid-1800's English style Gladstone Bag closure is just plain cool on this leather briefcase. It opens wide and stays open until you say otherwise. Pilots love this feature to put next to their seat. For closure, I chose a single leather strap with holes punched all the way out to the very tip, just in case your bag is way overstuffed or you want to stick your umbrella or blueprints under the strap horizontally or leave the laptop bag open to stick your stuff out vertically. The front pockets are built and then sewn on, so there are hidden pockets behind the pockets. This is a more expensive way to design a leather briefcase because it requires more leather, but it's also way more useful. 

- Opens wide and stays open
- Easily accessible in cramped spaces
- Strap with holes all the way to the end
